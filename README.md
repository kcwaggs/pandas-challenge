## Module 4 Challenge

## Dependencies: 
Data pack link: https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-2/m4/lms/starter/Starter_Code.zip
I used the the starter file from the data pack to begin my analysis
    PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb
    Renamed to: PyCitySchools.ipynb

## Notes:
When I first calculated the total budget, I did not think to use the separate CSV files to calculate it. I ended up formulating the total based on the merged dataframe. After some review I realized I could have simplified this by calculating the total budget from the original schools_complete.csv. I ended up creating total_budget_1 and total_budget_2 inputs to show you my calculations from 1 - the merged dataframe 2 - reading the original CSV.
